# Quiz-App

This app was created as a way for me to work on a Web API in ASP.net. It uses AngularJS on the front end.
It uses code first migrations to set up a relational database with questions about the C# programming
language. This was a fun project that helped me explore more of what the .NET framework has to offer!
